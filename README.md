# Primary job
What this bot do? It counts how many days until your birthday. On your first interaction, the bot will ask your name and your birthday with specific format. Then you'll get asked if you want to know how many days until your birthday.

This bot is developed with Express server and deployed to DigitalOcean with Nginx. All the conversation you send to the bot will be recorded to the database, so make sure you don't share your private information as this data will be available to public via Rest API.
